    - Identify patterns in missingness (random vs systematic)
    - Flag columns with >70% missing (consider dropping)

1.3 Data distribution analysis
    - Plot histograms for numerical columns
    - Check value ranges (grades 0-100, attendance 0-100)
    - Identify outliers and anomalies

1.4 Target variable analysis

2.4 Attendance standardization
    - Ensure all attendance values are 0-100 percentages
    - Handle impossible values (>100%, negative)
    - Create missing attendance flags

2.5 Remove duplicates and invalid records
    - Check for duplicate student_ids
